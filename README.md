# Idea
Idle Discord game bot where users can customize their own bobas to sell to other users and buy different toppings/customizations with coins

# Features
- User data is stored in MongoDB database
- Bobas created by users are generated with code, only using basic assets and layering them
- Toppings are populated progmatically
- Menus are also generated progmatically

# Dependencies
- Javacord (https://javacord.org/)
- Dotenv (https://github.com/cdimascio/dotenv-java)
- MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/)
